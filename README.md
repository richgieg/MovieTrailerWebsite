#Movie Trailer Website

This is the first project I've had to complete in my pursuit of the Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity. It's a simple web page that's generated dynamically from Python code. It showcases six comedy movies I enjoy and allows you to view the trailers. Thanks for looking!

3. In a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the code.
4. Run the following command:

5. This will generate a file called ```index.html``` and your default web browser should launch with the Movie Trailer Website displayed.

#Rich's Movie Trailer Website

This is the first project I've had to complete in my pursuit of the Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity. It's a simple web page that's generated dynamically from Python code. It showcases six comedy movies I enjoy and allows you to view their trailers. 

I've included a pre-generated ```index.html``` file if you'd like to view the page immediately without having to run the Python program to generate it. If you would like to generate the ```index.html``` file and perhaps edit the underlying Python code before doing so, please see the requirements and instructions below.

----
## requirements
* Python must be installed on your system.



----
## instructions
1. Download the code to your computer, using GitHub's "Download ZIP" button.
2. Unzip the code into a directory of your choice.
3. In a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the code.
4. Run the following command:
```
python generate_page.py
```
5. This will generate a file called ```index.html``` and your default web browser should launch with the Movie Trailer Website displayed.
